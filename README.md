# Cross Lingual Word Sense Disambiguation with WordNets

Implementation of Multilingual Sense Intersection (MSI), as described in Bond and Bonansinga (2015) and Bonansinga and Bond (2016).

## Installing

Required modules are listed in ```requirements.txt```. 

To get started, (optionally) activate a brand new Python 3.6+ virtual environment and install with ```pip```:

```
pip install < requirements.txt
```
## Getting Started

### Launch MSI yourself


* ```json_file_reader.py```: contains the JSON reader 
* ```corpus.py```: contains the classes used by the other scripts
* ```msi.py```: performs MSI

MSI has been performed on the Multilingual Parallel Corpus (MPC).
To carry out it yourself, clone the project, install the dependencies and run:

```
cd clwsd/code/
python msi.py -i ../files/json_files -l eng_ita_jpn_ron -f -e -d
```

The above command:
 - performs MSI on MPC (serialized in the json files contained in ```files/json_files```);
 - works with English, Italian, Japanese and Romanian;
 - sense frequencies are enabled;
 - evaluation is performed and printed to the standard output;
 - the result of MSI annotation is dumped to an XML file.

Parameters:

* ```-i, --json_input_folder```: accepts as input a folder structured as in ```files/json_files``` 
* ```-x, --xml_input_file```: accepts a compliant XML as input
* ```-l --languages```: lists the languages involved. Indicate valid ISO-639-2 language codes separated by _. Input corpora must be in languages having a wordnet in the Open Multilingual Wordnet.
* ```-f, --sense_frequencies```: enables sense frequencies
* ```-e, --evaluate```: outputs evaluation results (verbose)
* ```-d, --dump_xml_corpus```: produce the XML output corpus

### Or follow the demo in the Python notebook:

* run 
```pip install jupyter``` and then type
```jupyter notebook```

* this will make Jupyter available in localhost: go to  ```http://localhost:8888``` and open the notebook ```MSI_demo.ipynb```

* just read and enjoy... or run each step yourself!
