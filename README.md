# Cross Lingual Word Sense Disambiguation with WordNets

Implementation of Multilingual Sense Intersection (MSI), as described in Bond and Bonansinga (2015) and Bonansinga and Bond (2016).
## Getting Started

More information will come.

* ```core.py```: contains the JSON reader and XML reader 
* ```corpus.py```: contains the classes used by the other scripts
* ```msi.py```: performs MSI

### Installing

Required modules are listed in ```requirements.txt```. 

To get started, (optionally) activate a brand new Python 3.6+ virtual environment and install with ```pip```:

```
pip install < requirements.txt
```

## Todo List

- [x] Write module to dump ```Corpus```/```MultilingualCorpus``` object to XML 
- [x] Monolingual corpus template, compliant to NTUMC.dtd
- [x] Multilingual corpus template, compliant to NTUMC.dtd
- [x] Loaded sample multilingual corpus for document ```a01``` in English and Italian (cfr. ```examples\MPC.xml```)
- [x] basic MSI on EN-IT and evaluation
- [x] include support for external sense frequencies
- [x] include automatic alignments for each language pair
- [x] Load sample corpus with also Romanian and Japanese texts
- [x] Load sample corpus for SemCor document ```a01``` for all languages (```eng ita rom jpn```) with also MSI annotations
- [x] MSI code porting to Python3.7
- [x] Write JSON reader for MSI
- [x] Write XML reader for MSI
